# alien_invasion
Alien Invasion is a 2D space shooter game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving left and right with arrow keys and firing bullets with the spacebar to defend Earth from waves of descending aliens. Destroy entire fleets to advance levels, earn points, and avoid collisions that cost lives.
